                    <h2>Story</h2>
                    <p>You play as Momma Squirmle, whose goal is to become queen of Squirmland. In order to do so, she must become the longest Squirmle known to Squirm kind. She is going out to collect googly eyes to grow, but the communists don't like that and are trying to kill her. In order to save herself, she will poop out baby squirmles to sacrifice themselves and kamikaze on the communists.</p>    
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Esthetics</h2>
                    <p>Cartoonish and colorful graphics. Uplifting and looped music. Funny sound effects. Sounds are likely to be included on pickups, kamikaze, poop action, death, spawns, and buttons on UI.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Genre</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Action</li>
                        <li>Strategy</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="proposal-text">
                    <h2>Mechanics</h2>
                    <p>Momma Squirmle can only move in a grid formation, similar to the game Snake. She cannot overlap herself or else she will die from a heart attack. Her babies spawn where her tail is. Communists track onto Momma Squirrmle's head and they spawn on the edges of the map. Baby squirmles blowing up have a small radius, but can kill multiple communists at once.</p>

                        <li>A - Move left</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Mouse Movement - Baby squirmles will slowly follow your cursor</li>
                        <li>Spacebar - Spawns a baby / Self-destructs</li>

                    <h2>Displaying Instructions</h2>
                    <p>A tutorial to get the feel of movement from both Momma Squirmle and her babies and how to avoid enemies. Allow users to skip. Have an instructions section of the main menu too.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Player Learning</h2>
                    <p>I believe there will be strategy in grouping up the communists by leading your head in a different section of the map and having the baby wipe them all out at once.</p>
