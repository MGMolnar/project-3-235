                    <h2>What's a Squirmle?</h2>
                    <p>Ever see a worm with googly eyes and fur attached to a hidden string? Me neither! But there are toys for that and what better thing to base a game off of than these bad boys. You'll be playing as Momma Squirrmle as she tries to become queen of Squirmland by being the longest Squirmle possible.</p>

                    <h2>Communism?!</h2>
                    <p>You can't call this a game without a bit of communism thrown in. These communist squirmles want to kill you for taking all the googly eyes available. Luckily you can kill them too with the help of your kamikaze baby squirmles!</p>

                    <h2>Wait is this Snake?</h2>
                    <p>Yeah, but better. Snake can get pretty boring and repetitive but with this spinoff you now control way more than your WASD keys and have strategy involved with leading your Squirrmle away from the communists.</p>
